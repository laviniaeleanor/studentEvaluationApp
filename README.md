# Student Evaluation App

![alt text](https://github.com/laviniaeleanor/studentEvaluationApp/raw/master/Screenshot.png "Screenshot")

For the final assignment at [Codaisseur](https://codaisseur.com) we had to make an application that allowed teachers
to evaluation students.

To complete this task we had 4 days and it was an individual project.
For my final individual assignment with Codassieur Academy I built a Student Evaluation tool for Codaisseur teachers, based on the style of the company. This application allows the teacher to do the following:
___

* Add a class
* Add a student to the class
* Edit the student
* Delete the student
* Add evaluations for the student
* Pick a 'random' student from the class to ask a question.

___

To retrieve a 'random' student we were required to write an algorithm which picks a student based on the result of their last evaluation.

# Installation & Prerequisites
For installation & running the app best use: 
 [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) - Dependency Management

### Frontend: 
Open terminal, go to frontend folder, run "yarn install" start or "npm install" depending on your setup.
Then run "yarn start" or "npm start" This will run the app on port 3000 in your web browser. 

### Backend: 
Same as frontend, run "yarn install" for the dependencies. Afterwards run "nodemon ." in the terminal.

### Database: 
I'm running a docker container (port 5432) with a Postgres DB. A local DB should work as well.

## 3. Copyright etc.

### Build with:
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - The web framework used for frontend
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org) - State manager for React
* [TypeOrm](https://github.com/typeorm) - TypeScript focused ORM for the backend.
